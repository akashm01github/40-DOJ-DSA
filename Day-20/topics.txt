ğŸ”¹ forEach Practice

1. You have an array of numbers [2, 4, 6, 8]. Use forEach to print each number with the message:

2. Given an array of names ["Akash", "Papan", "Jharnna"], use forEach to print:
ğŸ‘‰ "Hello Akash", "Hello Papan", "Hello Jharnna".


ğŸ”¹ map Practice

1 . You have an array [1, 2, 3, 4]. Use map to create a new array where each number is doubled.
ğŸ‘‰ Expected result: [2, 4, 6, 8]

2. Given ["apple", "banana", "mango"], use map to create an array of word lengths.
ğŸ‘‰ Expected result: [5, 6, 5]


ğŸ”¹ filter Practice

1. You have [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]. Use filter to get only the even numbers.
